## Libraries Overview and Installation

### Introduction
This script uses several tools to process and analyze data, create visuals, and understand text. Below is a simplified explanation of what each library does and how to set it up.

---

1. **Pandas**  
   - **What it does**: Pandas helps organize and analyze data in tables, much like a spreadsheet. It makes working with large datasets easier and faster.It allows us to clean and explore data efficiently, such as finding patterns or missing information.  
   - **How to set it up**:  
     Open your terminal or command prompt and type:  
     ```bash
     pip install pandas
     ```

---

2. **Matplotlib**  
   - **What it does**: This library helps create charts and graphs, like bar charts or line graphs, to visualize data. It turns numbers into visuals, making the data easier to understand.  
   - **How to set it up**:  
     ```bash
     pip install matplotlib
     ```

---

3. **Plotly Express**  
   - **What it does**: Plotly Express helps make interactive charts that allow you to zoom, hover over points, and explore data more dynamically and it’s great for creating visuals that are both informative and interactive, perfect for presentations or dashboards.  
   - **How to set it up**:  
     ```bash
     pip install plotly
     ```

4. **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**  
   - **What it does**: NLTK is a toolkit that helps analyze and understand text, like breaking down sentences into words, removing unnecessary words, and simplifying words to their root forms and it is essential for processing written information, like finding key phrases or cleaning up messy text.  
   - **How to set it up**:  
     ```bash
     pip install nltk
     ```
     After installation, you need to download some tools within NLTK:
     ```python
     import nltk
     nltk.download('punkt')  # For splitting text into words
     nltk.download('stopwords')  # For removing unimportant words
     nltk.download('wordnet')  # For simplifying words
     ```

5. **String**  
   - **What it does**: String is a built-in Python tool for handling text, such as removing punctuation or extra spaces. It is powerful tool for cleaning and preparing text for analysis.  
   - **How to set it up**: No setup is needed—it’s already included in Python.

---

6. **Scipy**  
   - **What it does**: Scipy is a library used for mathematical calculations, like finding trends in numbers or understanding how data is distributed and helps measure things like how "skewed" (off-center) data is, which tells us if something unusual is happening in the data.  
   - **How to set it up**:  
     ```bash
     pip install scipy
     ```

---

7. **SentenceTransformers**  
   - **What it does**: This is an advanced tool that compares the meaning of sentences. It helps find similarities between different pieces of text, even if the wording is different. Important for analyzing and understanding large amounts of text, such as comparing job descriptions or categorizing text data.  
   - **How to set it up**:  
     ```bash
     pip install sentence-transformers
     ```

These libraries work together to help process, analyze, and visualize data in ways that are easy to understand.
